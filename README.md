## ExtendedKalmanFilterForKNR
# Repository where i document my work on the extended Kalman filter for usage in KNR Drone's biggest drone.

## Why am i creating this?

# Educational

I want to write my thesis on the EKF(Extended Kalman Filter) as part of my robotics and automation course. It's my own pet peeve project, something im passionate and enjoyed most during my time studying robotics.

# Functional

Our biggest drone has a glaring issue, it's positional accuracy prediction is poor to say the least. I have observed that when in flight it's positional parameters can deviate all the way up to 3m.

Therefore im making my own Kalman filter that ill feed data that is perfectly taken from sensors and it's deviations so it is as accurate as possible. I know there are EKGs(sometimes 3) in Ardupilots and PX4, but i really believe i can do better with just a bit of ingenuity.

# Fun

I love basics of automation and control, and want to make something using the knowledge i acquired on my countries top robotics course focused on BAC.

# Work

I plan on working in this field, therefore I will develop myself in this aspect so i can be a valuable worker.
